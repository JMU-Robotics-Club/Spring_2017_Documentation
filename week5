Robot Arms
We currently are able to move the the robot arm using sliders in a GUI to adjust the various aspects of the arm

1. Using existing robot arms
2. Clone the arbotix repository: https://github.com/vanadiumlabs/arbotix_ros.git
3. To install the moveit_core repository run the command:
    sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit
   This will need Professor Sprague's permission
4. To get the arm to run:
     roslaunch turtlebot_arm_bringup arm.launch
5. To get GUI:
     rosrun arbotix_python arbotix_gui
